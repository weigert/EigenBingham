# EigenBingham

C++ / Eigen3 implementation of the Bingham Directional Statistics Distribution, inspired by the Bingham Statistics Library, but with less additional stuff (like probability mass functions via finite element representation on the sphere)

## Motivation

I like Eigen, didn't want just a raw C interface. Generally cleaner syntax and stuff, less cluttered structure. Easier to read what's happening here. Also: Less stuff like PMFs which I don't understand why they were there and generally more concise readable syntax because of C++ templating, etc.

This is still in development so code is subject to change.
